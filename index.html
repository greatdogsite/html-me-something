      <h2>Deckwhat?</h2>
      <p>
         In the summer of 2021, I got the opportunity to work as a deckhand on a commercial salmon troller with my partner and her dad. 
         The job was for 8 weeks with 15-25 day stretches out on the open ocean for an unknown amount of pay. 
         I'd never spent much time on the ocean and certainly didn't know the first thing about fishing. 
         Sea-sickness was a big worry. 
         I'd heard stories of people being nauseous for weeks at a time, and as a flatlander, I was pretty sure that was going to be me.

         The learning curve was steep. Captain Gregg was a soft spoken man with 30 years of experience. 
         He could effortlessly pull salmon from the water and conk them in the perfect spot. 
         Me, not so much. 
         Not having much skill with a gaff, most of my early attempts ended with the salmon being quickly released.

      <h2>Time to make the Captain proud.</h2>

         Eventually, I started to understand how the boat worked. 
         I could run gear (a long line with lures on it), gaff fish, clean fish and store them properly in the freezer. 
         Next, I needed to learn how to glaze fish.

      <h2>Is it cold in here or is it just me?</h2>
      <p>
         Let me tell you, glazing fish is <b>terrible</b>. The idea behind glazing a fish is to seal the fish in ice to prevent freezer burn. 
         In order to get the right amount of glaze, the glazer stands in the freezer over a large bucket of salt water and slowly dips a fish in and out until the right amount of water flash freezes on the fish. 
         On average, the process takes 4 hours. 
         The temperature is -30* and the wind chill from the fan is -52*. Like I said, <b>terrible</b>.

      <h2>Gregg loves fish and we love Gregg.</h2>
         <p class="funParagraph">
            I am so thankful for my Alaskan fishing experience. Luckily, I didn't really get sea sick. 
            I learned a completely foreign skill set and I learned a lot about myself in the process. 
            We were able to fill the boat twice and Gregg seemed pretty pleased with our haul. 
            If I ever have the time, I would love to fish another season.
